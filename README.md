# Roblox API Tracker
This repository tracks Roblox API docs as they occur. It sends requests to every API up to once a minute and pushes the changes to this GitHub repository.
## What are all these folders and files?
Each folder represents documentation for one endpoint. For example, the folder named "Presence" refers to https://presence.roblox.com/docs  
Each file in each folder represents one version of each endpoint's documentation, like a file named "Presence v1.json" in the folder named "Presence".
