# Roblox API Tracker
This repository tracks Roblox API docs as they occur. It sends requests to every API up to once a minute and pushes the changes to this GitHub repository.
## What are all these files?
Each file contains the JSON for one version of one endpoint's docs.
For example, the file `presence v1.json` refrences the version 1 docs on https://presence.roblox.com/docs.
